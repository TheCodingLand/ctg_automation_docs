CTG automation is a set of components to facilitate setting up services integrated into cloud and on premise solutions.

## Goal

- Clear visibility of tools / licence used for each service (Trillian UI)
- Consistent reporting, whichever automation solution was used (on premise, cloud, scripts...) (Using Ebling API)
- Rapidly reusable Automation workflows by builing reusable optional library components, for interacting with emails, databases, Rest APIs and AI (Arcadia)
