## Why is this a challenge in the first place ?

The range of possible automation systems is wide, from servers to smarphones, and from on premise servers & kubernetes clusters to serverless cloud solutions.

This makes it difficult to obtain a visibility on:

- Existing Workflows per customers
- Which tools are used accross our client's sites
- Existing automation components
- Number of executions
- Resources and maintenance work
- AI models used
- Extract meaningful high visibility success stories
